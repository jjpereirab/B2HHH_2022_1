## Abstract
Charmless decays of charged *B* mesons to three-body final states are studied for $K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{\pm}$, $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{+}K^{-}K^{\pm}$ systems. Particle identification and other event selection criteria are applied to LHCb opendata from 2011 at a 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. Global raw asymmetries $A_{CP}(B^{\pm} \xrightarrow{} K^+ K^- \pi^{\pm}) = −0.065 \pm 0.022 \ (2.899\sigma)$, $A_{CP}(B^{\pm} \xrightarrow{} \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^{\pm}) = 0,045±0,009 \ (5.103σ)$ and $A_{CP}(B^{\pm} \xrightarrow{} K^+ K^- K^{\pm}) = −0,057±0,018 \ (3.152σ)$ are calculated through Dalitz plot amplitude analysis, finding evidence and observations of direct Charge-Parity violation. More data analysis strategies are developed and applied throughout the study of the systems, leading to results of even higher significance in localized regions of the phase space. The presented uncertainties are purely statistical, lower significance is expected if processes involving systematic uncertainties are considered.
